/**
 * Tool registry. The core hands `specs` to the model and routes each tool
 * call through the state service operation ledger. For the slice, only
 * state-internal tools are registered: their effects commit atomically
 * inside the claim transaction (no crash window between effect and receipt).
 *
 * message.send is outward-facing — speaking into the shared channel as the
 * secretary — so it may only run as an elevated call the human approves
 * (ADR 0013). A normal-route call is recorded as a structured block: the
 * Normal route never prompts the human and is never silently promoted.
 * The model may elevate any call itself via the route field of the
 * provider envelope.
 *
 * Other external-side-effect tools (send email, call a paid API) are
 * deliberately NOT in this registry — they need an external executor before
 * the model may invoke them.
